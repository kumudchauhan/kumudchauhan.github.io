        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Processing millions of digital receipts daily requires accurate, scalable information extraction from unstructured HTML documents — a challenging NLP problem at production scale.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Designed an in-house ML system for key information extraction from digital receipts. Fine-tuned Transformer-based LLM models (BERT/DistilBERT) using PyTorch and Hugging Face. Built end-to-end training and inference pipelines on Amazon SageMaker with distributed training and real-time endpoints. Implemented human-in-the-loop evaluation and automated model retraining with corrected examples. Integrated experiment tracking with MLflow and Comet for reproducibility.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>System processes 1M+ receipts/day in production with 92%+ accuracy at 95% recall. Resulted in a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US12288151B2/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US patent</a>.</p>
