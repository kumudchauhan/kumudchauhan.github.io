        <h4>Business Problem</h4>
        <p>Fetch was acquiring millions of new users through marketing campaigns and referrals, but a significant portion dropped off before completing their first receipt scan, the key activation event. Understanding where and why users were dropping off in the onboarding funnel was critical to improving the return on acquisition spend and growing the active user base.</p>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p><strong style="color: #0f172a;">Funnel Instrumentation</strong>, mapped the complete onboarding journey: app install, account creation, permission grants, first receipt scan, first offer redemption. Instrumented each step to track drop-off rates, time-to-complete, and user behavior patterns at each stage.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #0f172a;">Drop-off Analysis</strong>, identified the highest-friction steps in the funnel through quantitative analysis. Segmented drop-off patterns by acquisition channel, device type, and user demographics to understand if specific cohorts experienced disproportionate friction.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #0f172a;">Predictive Activation Signals</strong>, analyzed early user behavior to identify leading indicators of long-term retention. Found that specific actions within the first few sessions (e.g., scanning a second receipt within 7 days, redeeming a first offer) were strong predictors of 90-day retention.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #0f172a;">Experimentation</strong>, partnered with the product team to design and analyze A/B tests on onboarding flow changes (simplified permission prompts, first-scan incentives, and personalized offer recommendations during onboarding). Measured impact on activation rate and downstream retention.</p>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>Identified and quantified the key friction points in the onboarding funnel, directly informing product roadmap prioritization. Experimentation on onboarding changes led to measurable improvements in activation rate and early retention. The predictive activation signals informed a targeted re-engagement strategy for users at risk of dropping off before activation.</p>
