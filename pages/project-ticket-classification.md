        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Customer support teams were manually triaging tickets across 15 departments and 100+ granular categories, creating bottlenecks and slow response times.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Developed a multi-level, hierarchical text classification model ingesting millions of records from Zendesk. The model classifies complaints into 100+ granular categories and routes them to the appropriate department automatically.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>Reduced manual turnaround time by 18%, enabling the support team to focus on resolution rather than triage.</p>
