<p>I started my career at <strong>Bank of Baroda</strong>, India's third-largest public sector bank, spending four years in credit analytics across 131 million customers — building risk models, segmentation strategies, and data-driven campaigns. It taught me how to make decisions when the stakes are real and the data is messy. But the more I worked with data, the more I was drawn to what it could <em>predict</em>, not just describe. That curiosity about predictive analytics and machine learning became impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>I made the leap — moved to the United States to pursue my <strong>Master's in Analytics at Northeastern University</strong> (3.93 GPA), where I immersed myself in statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and machine learning. I served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant for the Predictive Analytics course</strong>, redesigning the curriculum and running TA office hours. My growing fascination with deep learning and NLP led me to pursue additional coursework through Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization alongside my degree. It was the foundation I needed to go from analyzing data to building intelligent systems.</p>

<p><strong>Fetch Rewards</strong> was where I truly came into my own. I joined as a Product Data Scientist in a fast-paced startup environment, diving into the data of 9 million active users — building KPI dashboards, performing deep-dive analyses, running A/B tests and experiments, and delivering reports and insights to senior leadership. Working closely with Product and Engineering teams gave me a broader perspective on how data drives business decisions and naturally opened the door to a leadership role.</p>

<p>I grew into a <strong>Senior Data Scientist and Tech Lead</strong>, specializing in NLP and document understanding. I owned the complete ML lifecycle for Fetch's <strong>patented digital receipt information extraction system</strong> — processing over a million receipts daily in production. I designed the in-house ML system to extract key information from digital receipts, built semantic search systems, fine-tuned LLMs using Hugging Face, shipped models on Amazon SageMaker, and led a cross-functional team of engineers, data scientists, and MLEs. This work resulted in a <strong>patent</strong> for the ML-based receipt extraction system, and I also published research at <strong>EMNLP 2020</strong> on data augmentation techniques for BERT. Fetch gave me the opportunity to evolve from an individual contributor into a technical leader — and I grabbed it with both hands.</p>

<p>I took a deliberate career break for pregnancy and early childcare. During this time, I kept myself continuously learning — staying current with the rapid advancements in GenAI, LLMs, and agentic AI architectures.</p>

<p>Today, I'm back with renewed focus and deeper expertise in <strong>LLMs, RAG, and Agentic AI</strong>. I'm currently working as an independent contractor through Mercor on LLM evaluations and frontier AI red teaming, while actively seeking my next full-time opportunity in Data Science & Analytics. I'm a <strong>Green Card holder</strong> and do not require visa sponsorship now or in the future.</p>
