        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Only 30% of receipt line items were being automatically matched to the product catalog, requiring heavy manual review and limiting the value of receipt data at scale.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Designed a semantic search and retrieval system using SBERT embeddings and FAISS vector indexing to match receipt items to a structured product catalog. Implemented a retrieval-augmented approach combining semantic embeddings with fallback strategies — rules, fuzzy search, and TF-IDF cosine similarity — to handle edge cases and boost overall coverage. Defined a 50K+ stratified golden dataset for evaluation and optimized the precision-recall tradeoff through calibration.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>Improved product match coverage from 30% to 80%+ with 95% precision. Top-1 accuracy went from 45% to 88%, reducing manual review by 12% across billions of line items and 11M+ receipts.</p>
