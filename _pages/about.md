I am currently a data science volunteer at FightPandemics, where I'm working on several projects related to building an Altruistic Platform. I mainly contribute to chatbot development, data pipeline design and data analysis projects.
I earned my Masters degree in Analytics with Statistical Modeling concentration from Northeastern University, Boston. During my masters I also worked as Graduate Teaching Assistant for predictive Analytics course and had a great opportunity to work with two amazing professors at NEU.

Before joining grad school, I worked as a Credit Analyst with the third largest Bank of India. The real-world applications of analytics and data science in Banking motivated me to pursue my career in the field of Data Science and I came to NEU for graduation.
Natural Language Processing is one of the my area of interest and I want to solve language related challenges to grow in this field.
I grew up in the amazing city of Roorkee, India.
