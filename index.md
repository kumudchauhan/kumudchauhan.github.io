I am a data science volunteer at [FightPandemics](https://fightpandemics.com/), where I'm working on several projects related to building an Altruistic Platform. I mainly contribute to chatbot development, data pipeline design and data analysis projects.


I earned my Masters degree in Analytics with Statistical Modeling concentration from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), Boston. During my masters I also worked as Graduate Teaching Assistant for predictive Analytics course and had a great opportunity to work with two amazing professors at NEU.

Before joining grad school, I worked as a Credit Analytics Manager with [Bank of Baroda](https://www.bankofbaroda.in/),India.
