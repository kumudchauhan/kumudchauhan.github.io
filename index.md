##### Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Former Banker | NEU Alumni 

I am a motivated, result-oriented, and enthusiastic data science professional with a keen interest in Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I am working as a Data Science and Business Intelligence volunteer at [FightPandemics](https://fightpandemics.com/), I'm also collaborating with the Product and Engineering team and working on multiple projects related to building an Altruistic Platform. I mainly contribute to [chatbot development](https://github.com/FightPandemics/FightPandemics-Telegram/tree/dev), data pipeline design, and data analysis projects.

I earned my Master's degree in Analytics with Statistical Modeling concentration from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), Boston. During my masters, I also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for two sections of the predictive Analytics course. 

Before joining grad school, I worked as a Credit Analytics Manager with [Bank of Baroda](https://www.bankofbaroda.in/), India. I lead a team of 7 people and implemented various financial inclusion initiatives in Rural India. I worked with cross-functional teams and successfully executed multiple financial campaigns to promote digital banking and loan products. I automated multiple manual tasks by applying data analytics and predictive modeling.
